10/14	14:30	1:00	Wrote further tests for YAML

TOTAL time: 11 hours 

The most difficult part of this assignment was to find what methods I wanted to use in python and to figure out exactly how they were used. For instance, when using regular expressions, I had to make sure that the strings I was searching for would match exactly what I wanted and nothing more or less. In other cases, I had to spend extra effort to make sure that I had the desired behavior in various edge cases for the functions I was using. Finally, for some reason my computer kept having kernel panics when I tried to use the subprocess module, so that slowed down writing test scripts. Eventually, I just wrote all the test scripts in bash.
